# Learn ðŸ§  

**Learn** is an AI-native, self-hostable tool designed to make learning limitless, scalable, and accessible for anyoneâ€”anytime, anywhere.

## Vision  

Learning should be limitless and self-sufficient. Whether you're preparing for exams, mastering a new language, or traveling to Mars, the tools we use to learn must support curiosity without barriers.  

Our vision is to create a self-reliant learning assistant that helps users generate, organize, and retain knowledge effortlessly, allowing anyone, anywhere to learn *anything*.  

## Problem Statement   

Existing learning tools and workflows are disjointed, making it difficult to create and manage personalized study content. Current solutions require users to jump between platforms for reading, note-taking, flashcard generation, and spaced repetition. This fragmentation creates unnecessary friction and wasted time, ultimately slowing down the learning process.  

But now, with local AI, you can generate tailored, virtually limitless study contentâ€”all while keeping everything private and self-hosted.  

**Learn** is designed with:
- Language learning in mind (but works just as well for other subjects),  
- On-the-fly flashcard creation: click a word or sentence, and it's instantly saved to your deck,  
- A mission to empower learning enthusiasts to dive deeper into *whatever* they wish to master.  


## Why Are We Building This? ðŸŒŒ  

As we venture into a future where connectivity isnâ€™t guaranteed (think extended space travel or offline educational settings), self-contained, adaptable tools will be essential. Learning doesnâ€™t stop when the internet is goneâ€”it shouldnâ€™t have to.  

We're on a mission to create a scalable, autonomous learning tool designed for humans at the edge of possibilityâ€”whether thatâ€™s on Earth, Mars, or in orbit for months. With `Learn`, youâ€™ll have everything you need to explore and master knowledge in isolation, distraction-free.
